# Log 25 (Duration: 1/6 Months)
Today, I revisited my understanding of fundamental JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM), putting my knowledge into practice by developing a small game centered around the alphabet. In the game, earning points involves successfully pressing keys on the keyboard in response to the instructed key displayed on the screen, without looking at it. Each accurate guess results in earning one point. However, pressing the incorrect key leads to losing a life. Consequently, losing all our allocated lives results in the end of the game, and the final score will be revealed.
